# PO-TAY-TOES

#This is my final project for Code Kentucky's Data Analysis 1 course. Ideally, it will be ran in Google Colab. The user will mount drive, upload the file named potato_pictures to drive>MyDrive, then all of the file paths should stay the same. 

The libraries used are built into Google Colab, such as pandas and matplot lib. 

Features of this project include: a dictionary, data read in from a local csv, manipulated (sorted) data, built-in pandas functions, 2 basic plots, and markdown cells.

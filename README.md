# PO-TAY-TOES

#This is my final project for Code Kentucky's Data Analysis 1 course. Ideally, it will be ran in Google Colab. The user will mount drive, upload files in the potato_pictures folder to a folder named potato_pictures in drive>MyDrive, then all of the file paths should stay the same. The easiest way to do this is to open this google drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1feDZZ3DevmFVsi3vidK9DI3SSA0LqZeo?usp=sharing, then click the down arrow next to the filename potato_pictures and select "Add shortcut to my drive."

The libraries used are built into Google Colab, such as pandas and matplotlib. 

Features of this project include: a dictionary, data read in from a local csv, manipulated (sorted) data, built-in pandas functions, 2 basic plots, and markdown cells.

Hope you enjoy!
